Clicky - Game: React | JavaScript | Node.js | Bootstrap 

Front-end App built in React that renders different emojis images to the screen. Each emoji listens for click events. This game keeps track of the user's score. The user's score increments when clicking an emoji's image for the first time and the user's score is reset to 0 if they click the same emoji image more than once.
